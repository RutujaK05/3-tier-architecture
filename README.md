# 🏗️ 3-Tier Architecture in AWS

This project demonstrates a basic **3-Tier Web Application Architecture** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using best practices for scalability, high availability, and security.

---

## 📚 Overview

The 3-Tier Architecture separates the application into three distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer** – Handles incoming requests and user interaction.
2. **Application Layer** – Business logic and server-side operations.
3. **Data Layer** – Persistent storage for application data.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Highly Available (Multi-AZ)
- ✅ Scalable with Auto Scaling Groups
- ✅ Secure with Private/Public Subnets and Security Groups
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code (optional: Terraform/CloudFormation)
- ✅ Centralized Logging and Monitoring

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- IAM permissions to create VPC, EC2, RDS, ELB, etc.
- (Optional) Terraform or CloudFormation installed

### Setup Options

#### Option 1: Manual Setup via AWS Console

1. Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
2. Launch an **Application Load Balancer** in the public subnet.
3. Launch EC2 instances in private subnets (behind ALB).
4. Create an **Auto Scaling Group** for EC2.
5. Launch an **Amazon RDS** instance in a private subnet.
6. Configure security groups and routing.

#### Option 2: Infrastructure as Code

Coming soon: Terraform/CloudFormation templates.

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

- Use **IAM Roles** for EC2 instead of hardcoding credentials.
- Store DB passwords in **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store**.
- Restrict security group rules to necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, 3306).
- Enable **Multi-AZ** for RDS for high availability.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for EC2 and RDS metrics.
- Enable **CloudWatch Logs Agent** on EC2 for application logs.
- Use **CloudTrail** for auditing AWS API activity.
